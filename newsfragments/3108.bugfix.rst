Rework KeyboardInterrupt protection to track code objects, rather than frames,
as protected or not. This should substantially reduce its overhead, and also fixes
an issue with the previous implementation: locals' lifetimes will no longer be
extended by materialization in the ``frame.f_locals`` dictionary that the previous
KI protection logic needed to access to do its work.
